free_doge_lottery_bot
======================
This is the source code for the free doge lottery bot on reddit, /u/freedogelottery which takes the last 200 comments from /r/dogecoin and chooses one, tipping them 20 doge.

All required modules come preinstalled in python except PRAW, which must be installed manually using pip.

Note: The script will not work as is because I removed the password (Duh.)

This is a fork of random_act_of_doge.

Credit- Thanks to /u/spacer0cketfor cleaning up the code and adding some cool new features!

Credit 2- Thanks to Panchr(I don't know your reddit username) who wrote the code that sends a reply that says how long the bot is funded for! That was a big help!
